# NDA Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) feature for the Smartjects platform that allows proposal creators to add confidential fields requiring NDA signatures to view.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Confidential Field Management
- **Private Field Toggle**: Added switches to enable confidential versions of any proposal field
- **Dual Field Input**: Users can input both public and private versions of the same information
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear UI distinctions between public and confidential content
- **Field Coverage**: Implemented for all major proposal fields (scope, timeline, budget, deliverables, requirements, expertise, approach, team, additional info)

### 2. NDA Signing System
- **Digital NDA**: Built-in legal NDA document with standard confidentiality terms
- **Signature Tracking**: Complete audit trail of who signed and when
- **Access Control**: Automatic field visibility based on signature status
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Modal dialog with clear terms and agreement checkbox

### 3. Security & Access Control
- **Proposal Owner Access**: Owners can always view all fields (public and private)
- **Signature-Based Access**: Non-owners must sign NDA to view confidential fields
- **Database Security**: Row-level security policies protect sensitive data
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper type definitions

## Database Migrations Required

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Run these SQL commands before using the feature**

```sql
-- 1. Add private fields column to proposals
ALTER TABLE proposals ADD COLUMN private_fields JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- 2. Create NDA signatures table
CREATE TABLE proposal_nda_signatures (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  proposal_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES proposals(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  signer_user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  signed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(proposal_id, signer_user_id)
);

-- 3. Create performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_proposal_nda_signatures_proposal_id ON proposal_nda_signatures(proposal_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_proposal_nda_signatures_signer_user_id ON proposal_nda_signatures(signer_user_id);

-- 4. Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE proposal_nda_signatures ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 5. Create RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view relevant NDA signatures" ON proposal_nda_signatures
  FOR SELECT USING (
    signer_user_id = auth.uid() OR 
    proposal_id IN (SELECT id FROM proposals WHERE user_id = auth.uid())
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can sign NDAs" ON proposal_nda_signatures
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (signer_user_id = auth.uid());
```

## How It Works

### 1. Proposal Creation/Editing Flow
1. User creates or edits proposal normally
2. Starting from Step 2 (Project Details), each field has a toggle for "Add confidential version"
3. When enabled, user can input both public and private versions
4. Private fields are stored in `proposals.private_fields` JSONB column
5. Proposal is saved/updated with both public and confidential data
6. **Edit Mode**: Existing private fields are loaded and can be modified or disabled

### 2. Negotiation & NDA Flow
1. User views proposal during negotiation
2. NDA Manager component appears in right sidebar
3. If proposal has private fields and user hasn't signed NDA:
   - Private fields show "NDA Required" placeholder
   - NDA signing button is displayed in sidebar
4. User clicks "Sign NDA" and reviews legal terms
5. After signing, private fields become visible immediately
6. Signature is recorded in database with timestamp
7. Proposal owner can see all signatures in the sidebar

### 3. Access Control Logic
```typescript
// Real implementation in ndaService
canViewPrivateFields = await ndaService.canViewPrivateFields(
  proposalId, 
  userId, 
  proposalOwnerId
);
// Returns: (userId === proposalOwnerId) || hasSignedNDA(userId, proposalId)
```

## Testing the Feature

### 1. Complete Test Scenario
1. **Create Proposal**: Create a proposal with private fields enabled
2. **Add Content**: Fill both public and private versions of fields  
3. **Submit**: Save/submit the proposal
4. **Edit Proposal**: Test editing with private fields preserved
5. **Switch User**: Log in as different user
6. **Navigate**: Go to negotiation page for the proposal
7. **Verify Restriction**: Confirm private fields are hidden
8. **Check Sidebar**: Verify NDA manager appears in right sidebar
9. **Sign NDA**: Use the NDA signing interface
10. **Verify Access**: Confirm private fields are now visible
11. **Owner View**: Switch back to proposal owner and verify signature tracking

### 2. Using Test Utils
```typescript
import { NDATestUtils } from '@/components/private-field-manager/nda-test-utils';

// Use in development to test the feature
<NDATestUtils proposalId="your-proposal-id" />
```

### 3. Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create proposal with private fields ✅
- [ ] Edit proposal with private fields ✅  
- [ ] View proposal as different user ✅
- [ ] Verify private fields are hidden ✅
- [ ] Sign NDA successfully ✅
- [ ] Verify private fields become visible ✅
- [ ] Check signature appears in sidebar ✅
- [ ] Test as proposal owner (should always see all fields) ✅

## Data Structure

### Private Fields Storage
```json
{
  "scope": "Confidential project details...",
  "timeline": "Internal timeline information...",
  "budget": "Detailed budget breakdown...",
  "deliverables": "Sensitive deliverable details...",
  "requirements": "Confidential requirements...",
  "expertise": "Proprietary expertise information...",
  "approach": "Confidential implementation approach...",
  "team": "Internal team structure details...",
  "additionalInfo": "Other confidential information..."
}
```

### NDA Signature Record
```typescript
interface NDASignature {
  id: string;
  proposalId: string;
  signerUserId: string;
  signedAt: string;
  createdAt: string;
}
```

## Security Considerations

### 1. Data Protection
- Private fields stored securely in JSONB format
- Database-level access controls via RLS policies
- No client-side exposure without proper authorization

### 2. Legal Compliance
- Standard NDA terms implemented
- Signature timestamps for audit trail
- One signature per user per proposal

### 3. Access Control
- Proposal owners: Full access always
- Other users: Access only after NDA signature
- Real-time permission checking

## Performance Notes

- Database indexes created for fast signature lookups
- JSONB used for flexible private field storage  
- Efficient querying with composite indexes
- Minimal overhead on existing queries
- **TypeScript Optimized**: All components fully typed for optimal performance
- **Component Reusability**: PrivateFieldManager can be reused across forms
- **Lazy Loading**: NDA signatures loaded only when needed

## Future Enhancements

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Custom NDA Terms**: Allow proposal owners to customize NDA text
2. **Email Notifications**: Notify when NDAs are signed
3. **Expiration Dates**: Add time-limited access
4. **Bulk Management**: Admin tools for NDA management

### Advanced Features
1. **Document Attachments**: Upload custom NDA documents
2. **Multi-party NDAs**: Support for complex negotiations
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Track NDA signing patterns
4. **Integration APIs**: Connect with external legal systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Use direct service imports if index imports fail
2. **Type Errors**: Ensure latest TypeScript compilation
3. **Database Errors**: Verify all migrations have been run
4. **Permission Issues**: Check RLS policies are active

### Debug Tools
- Use `NDATestUtils` component for comprehensive testing
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify database constraints and indexes

## Support & Maintenance

### Monitoring
- Track NDA signature rates
- Monitor database query performance
- Watch for access control violations

### Updates
- Keep legal terms current with regulations
- Update UI/UX based on user feedback
- Enhance security measures as needed
